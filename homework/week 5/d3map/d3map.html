      Population Density word 2015

      I have chosen to highlight the borders in a dark color on mouseover to clearly display the outlines of a land.
      I have chosen not to change te color of the land on mouseover because the land is already
      clear from the outlines and if it keeps the original color you can still see the population density by color.
      On mouseover a tip displays the country and the number of people that live on a square metre.
      This function is useful if you want to know the exact number of people that live on a square meter, and not
      only an indication like in the color scheme.
      I have chosen to display that data in a tip and not on the map itself so the overview is easier to look at,
      and also for small countries it would not fit. Now the same method can be applied to all countries.
